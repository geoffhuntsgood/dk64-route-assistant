# DK64 Route Assistant

This is a simple React/Vite app that displays routes for DK64. It also provides simplified split files and links to the referenced Google Docs.

It's intended to be used on mobile, or as a browser source in OBS/streaming software. (That's why it'll look..._wide_ on larger screens.)

It also only has Wii U VC routes as of now.

Current routes include:
- 101% Intermediate
- any% 1-Kong (2014)
- any% Glitchless
- NLE (Helm Escape)

I have this app hosted at geoffhuntsgood.com/dk64router, but if you have Node.js on your machine you can run it yourself. Just:
- Clone the repository
- CD to that directory in your terminal
- Run "npm i && npm run dev"
- The app will now run at localhost:5173 in your browser.

Any and all feedback is welcome, just create an issue in GitHub.

Happy routing!
