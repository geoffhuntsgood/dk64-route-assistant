# DK64 Router

This is a simple React/Vite app that displays routes for DK64. It also provides links to source material Google Docs.

It's intended to be used on mobile, or as a browser source in OBS/streaming software. (That's why it'll look..._wide_ on larger screens.)

It also only has Wii U VC routes as of now.

You can navigate through the route using the arrow keys:
- Up and down will scroll normally
- Left and right will jump between segments (usually levels and segments between levels).

Current routes include:
- 101%:
- - Beginner (w/video links for most tricks)
- - Intermediate
- - Expert (w/phasewalks)
- any%:
- - 5-Kong
- - 1-Kong (2014)
- - 1-Kong (2015)
- NLE:
- - Intermediate 40BP
- - Advanced 40BP
- - Helm Escape
- Category Extensions:
- - Glitchless Any%
- - Tag Anywhere NLE
- - Tag Anywhere 101% (Currently experimental)

I have this app hosted at geoffhuntsgood.com/dk64router, but if you have Node.js on your machine you can run it yourself. Just:
- Clone the repository
- CD to that directory in your terminal
- Run "npm i && npm run dev"
- The app will now run at localhost:5173 in your browser.

Any and all feedback is welcome, just create an issue in GitHub.

Happy routing!
