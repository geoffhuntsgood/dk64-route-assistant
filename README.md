# DK64 Router

This is a simple React/Vite app that displays routes for DK64. It also provides links to source material Google Docs.

It's intended to be used on mobile, or as a browser source in OBS/streaming software. (That's why it'll look..._wide_ on larger screens.)

## Features

- Show/hide counts for:
- - Golden Bananas
- - Blueprints
- - Battle Crowns
- - Banana Fairies
- - Banana Medals
- - Boss Keys
- N64/Wii U VC toggle for console-specific routes
- Dark mode

## Currently Unintuitive Stuff

- You can jump between sections with the left/right arrow keys,
or by pressing the arrows on the header bar.
- Clicking on the title of the route will bring you back to the main page.

## Run Locally

I have this app hosted at geoffhuntsgood.com/dk64router, but if you have Node.js on your machine you can run it yourself. Just:
- Clone the repository
- CD to that directory in your terminal
- Run "npm i && npm run dev"
- The app will now run at localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Happy Routing!
